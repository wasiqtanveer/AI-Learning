If a function inside a class does not use any object (instance) attributes,  
we donâ€™t need to pass 'self'. Instead, we use a static method.  

A static method is a function inside a class that:  
- Does not access or modify instance attributes.  
- Does not need 'self' because it does not use the object itself.  
- Works independently like a normal function but is still part of the class.  
We define it using @staticmethod.
